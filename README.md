### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am the creator of [Thunder Client](https://www.thunderclient.com/) - Lightweight Rest API Client extension for VS Code. 

Thunder Client was launched on `March 31st, 2021`. Since then, it has been downloaded by more than `4 million` developers worldwide.

### About Ranga Vadhineni
I am a software engineer with over 15 years of experience in building products. Ever since my college days, Iâ€™ve been fascinated by startups like YouTube, Flickr, and MySpace. The idea of creating something that could go viral and be used by millions always inspired me. With that dream in mind, I chose programming as a profession, knowing it would equip me to build my own products.

I launched my first startup, [Localmint.com](https://www.localmint.com/), in 2010, and successfully scaled it to reach 1 million visits per month. In the process, I sharpened my technical skills and gained valuable experience in scaling a product from the ground up. Localmint generated enough revenue for me to quit my job in 2014 and focus full-time on building new startup ventures. While Localmint didnâ€™t evolve into a large company, it gave me the financial freedom and confidence to pursue other innovative ideas.

Since then, Iâ€™ve launched three other projectsâ€”though they didnâ€™t succeed, they taught me invaluable lessons in persistence and innovation. In 2021, I finally found the breakthrough Iâ€™d been searching for with [Thunder Client](https://www.thunderclient.com), a lightweight REST API client for VS Code, which went viral and has been downloaded by over 4 million users worldwide. You can read more about the Thunder Client launch [story here](https://medium.com/thunderclient/thunder-client-alternative-to-postman-68ee0c9486d6).

Thunder Client has been a game-changer, offering developers a simplified and efficient tool to interact with APIs without the bloat of other solutions. Iâ€™m proud to have built something thatâ€™s become an essential tool for so many in the developer community.
